# Autonomous Mobile Robot Systems Integration Framework

This repository presents a modular systems integration framework for Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs).

It demonstrates a full stack from perception and localization to planning, control, and an integration pipeline.
The code is lightweight and focused on clarity so it can be extended for real robots or used as a portfolio project.
